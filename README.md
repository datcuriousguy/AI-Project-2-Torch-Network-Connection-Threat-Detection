# Torch-NN-Project-2-Network-Connection-Threat-Detection
This project simulates a large organization's network, which regularly faces malicious connection attempts like DDoS, hacking, or malware. These threats often share traits such as high request rates, unusual ports, and frequent rejections. We want to design a Torch Neural Network that detects these suspicious connection attempts.
